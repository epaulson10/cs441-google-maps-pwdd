1.0 Introduction

Critical to the University of Portland’s standing is the admissions team, whose task 
is to recruit quality students for the university. These individuals use admissions 
data gathered from applicants to determine where to concentrate their recruiting efforts. 
Until now, the admissions team has used spreadsheets to analyze their data. However, that 
method is clunky and overwhelming. This project seeks to improve this process by creating 
a web application that visualizes admissions data on a map in an understandable and 
convenient format.


2.0 How To Use
To use the Data Visualization Tool, use the following steps:

1. Open index.html (located in the same directory as this readme file).
2. In the top-left dropdown, choose the type of region you want to see admissions information
   about (state, city, zip code, high school or CEEB).
3. Type into the text field, next to the "Search By" dropdown, what you want to search
   for.
   The formats for the search types are as follows:
      -State: Two letter capital abbreviation. E.g. OR
      -City: City name. E.g. Portland
      -Zip: 5 digit number. E.g. 97267
      -CEEB: The full CEEB code for a high school. E.g. 380000
      -High School: A high school name. E.g. Burns High School
4. Press "Lookup" button.
5. ???
6. Profit
