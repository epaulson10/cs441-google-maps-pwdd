  * **Version Control Monitor - Kyle DeFrancia:** Person who has an expertise in git, monitors check-ins by all team members, and affirms that the master branch is ready and working for pull by Dr. Crenshaw.

# Protocols #

## Team Disputes Protocol ##

There may be situations during the course of the project where a team member is not able to perform a task that was assigned to them. This may be for one of two reasons:
  1. The person is struggling with the task and cannot seem to finish.
  1. The person has neglected or forgotten their responsibilities.

Depending on which of these two is the case, there will be separate sets of steps taken.

  * If the task has not been completed because of reason 1, and the individual has expressed his concerns with the group prior to the deadline in question, the other members will offer a reasonable amount of assistance. If the team member is still having issues, they will be directed to receive further assistance from Dr. Crenshaw. If there is a specific member of the team that is consistently unable to complete their tasks, and the team has concerns as to whether the member will be able to contribute to the project, only then will the problem be presented to Dr. Crenshaw for assistance. If the team member is unable to complete their given tasks for reason 1, and they fail to notify the group of their issues, they will be given a verbal warning/reminder from the group. Again if this becomes a pattern, the issue will be presented to Dr. Crenshaw.

  * If the task has not been completed because of reason 2, and the individual expresses good reasoning to the group prior to the deadline for completion, there will be no recourse. For example, if someone is ill or has an emergency to attend to and will not be able to complete their tasks on time, it is reasonable to explain their situation to the group so that the task may be re-allocated. If, however, there is a failure to complete one’s work and there is no explanation prior to the deadline, the person will be warned/reminded of their duties once. Upon a second instance of failure to complete one’s work without explanation, the problem will be presented to Dr. Crenshaw.
